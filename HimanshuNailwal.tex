\runsubsection{Data Analytics}
\descript{| Electricity Generation Forecasting System }
\location{Technology used: Machine Learning, Hadoop }
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize} 
\item Uses Big Data analytics to process the data collected(Hadoop and MapReduce) 
\item Applied a ML model(Artificial Neural Network) to train the system for the prediction stage
\end{tightemize}
\sectionsep

\runsubsection{MAJOR PROJECT}
\descript{| Content Based Video Authentication }
\location{Technology used: MATLAB, Cryptography }
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}\item Provided authentication mechanism for H.264/AVC video format, watermark for authentication is extracted from the content itself.
\item Emphasis on getting high PSNR value , also taking into account the recognition of attack on the videos.
\item Used frequency domain technique i.e. Discrete Wavelet Tranform(DWT)
\end{tightemize}
